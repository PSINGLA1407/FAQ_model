## Prerequisites

Before setting up this project, ensure that the following software is installed on your system:

- **Python 3.9+**: Required for running the Django app.
- **Docker**: For containerizing the application.
- **Docker Compose** (optional): If you want to use Docker Compose for managing multiple containers.

## Project Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

Start by cloning the project repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your_django_app.git
cd your_django_app
```

### 2. Install dependencies

It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage the dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you don’t have `requirements.txt`, it can be generated by running:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

---

## Running Locally

To run the Django application locally, use the following steps:

1. **Database Setup**:
   First, set up your database (SQLite or PostgreSQL). If you choose PostgreSQL, you will need to modify the `settings.py` to match your database credentials.

2. **Migrate the Database**:
   Run migrations to set up the necessary database tables:

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

3. **Run the Development Server**:
   Start the Django development server:

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

   The app will be accessible at [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/).

## Running with Docker

This project also supports running the app inside a Docker container. Follow these steps to run it using Docker:

### 1. **Build the Docker Image**

Build the Docker image from the Dockerfile:

```bash
docker build -t your_django_app .
```

### 2. **Run the Docker Container**

Run the container, exposing port `8000` (or any other port) to the outside world:

```bash
docker run -d -p 87:8000 your_django_app
```

This will map port `8000` inside the container to port `87` on your host machine.

### 3. **Access the App**

Once the container is running, you can access the Django application by visiting [http://localhost:87](http://localhost:87) or [http://<EXTERNAL_IP>:87](http://<EXTERNAL_IP>:87).

### 4. **Stopping the Docker Container**

To stop the container, you can use:

```bash
docker stop <container_id>
```

## Django API

This project can include Django REST Framework for building APIs. You can create and manage APIs by adding serializers, views, and URLs. Here’s an example of how you can define a basic API endpoint:

1. **Create a Serializer**:

   ```python
   from rest_framework import serializers
   from .models import YourModel

   class YourModelSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
       class Meta:
           model = YourModel
           fields = '__all__'
   ```

2. **Create a View**:

   ```python
   from rest_framework import viewsets
   from .models import YourModel
   from .serializers import YourModelSerializer

   class YourModelViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
       queryset = YourModel.objects.all()
       serializer_class = YourModelSerializer
   ```

3. **Register the View in URLs**:

   ```python
   from django.urls import path, include
   from rest_framework.routers import DefaultRouter
   from .views import YourModelViewSet

   router = DefaultRouter()
   router.register(r'yourmodel', YourModelViewSet)

   urlpatterns = [
       path('api/', include(router.urls)),
   ]
   ```

---

## Development

### 1. **Running Tests**

You can run your tests with the Django test runner:

```bash
python manage.py test
```

If you're using Docker, ensure your Docker container is running before testing.

### 2. **Creating a Superuser**

If you want to access the Django admin interface, create a superuser:

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

---

## Deployment

You can deploy this Django application on various platforms such as AWS, Heroku, or your own server. The recommended approach is to use Docker to ensure a smooth deployment process.

- **For Docker-based deployment**, follow the steps to build and run the image, and ensure proper networking and environment configurations.

For deployment to **Heroku**, use the following command:

```bash
git push heroku master
```

Ensure you have added a `Procfile` to your project with the following content:

```
web: gunicorn your_django_app.wsgi:application
```
